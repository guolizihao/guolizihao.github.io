# -- *``Finite-Time Error Bounds for Biased Stochastic Approximation Algorithms with Application to /Q/-Learning''* This paper develops a multistep Lyapunov approach for non-asymptotic analysis of biased stochastic approximation. When applying our results to TD- and Q-learning with (non)linear function approximation, we provide the first finite-time error bounds for TD- and Q-learning that hold from the first iteration and Markov chains starting with any initial distribution.
# -- *``Finite-Time Analysis of Decentralized Temporal-Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation''* This paper develops the first finite-time error bound for fully decentralized TD-learning under Markovian data samples.
